About Varsom

Make better plans when in the backcountry or on lakes. Prevent damages from floods through better knowledge. Tell us about avalanches. Together we may save lives and minimize losses due to avalanches, floods, landslides and dangerous ice conditions.

This app gathers in one place the most important features from the Varsom Platform needed in the outdoors, for field inspections and for preparedness, crisis management and rescue. Observations from regobs.no, warnings from varsom.no, and support maps from xgeo.no and iskart.no.

The app supports English language, and visitors from abroad may read and submit observations and read our warnings. As a bonus, the app now works well outside Norway.

Varsom and the warning services for avalanches, landslides, ice conditions and floods are services provided by Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) in cooperation with The Norwegian Public Roads Administration and The Norwegian Meteorological Institute.
